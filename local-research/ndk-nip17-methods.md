Querying perplexity using sonar for: How to implement NIP-17 direct messages with NIP-44 encryption using @nostr-dev-kit/ndk version 2.14.35 - what are the correct methods and APIs? with maxTokens: 21000
To implement **NIP-17 direct messages with NIP-44 encryption** using **@nostr-dev-kit/ndk v2.14.35**, you need to use NDK's APIs to:

1. **Encrypt message content** according to NIP-44 encryption (which uses secp256k1 ECDH, HKDF, ChaCha20, HMAC-SHA256, base64, version 0x02 format).

2. **Create and publish Nostr events** of kind `14` for direct messages as per NIP-17 specification, ensuring the message content is encrypted with NIP-44 and the event `content` field holds the encrypted payload.

3. **Use correct tags**:
   - `p` tags for one or more intended recipient pubkeys (with optional relay hints).
   - `e` tag if the message is a reply.
   - Optional `subject` tag for conversation titles.

4. **Avoid signing content in the message** because kind `14` must not be signed fully to prevent exposure of plaintext.

### Key Points and method overview:

- **Encryption (NIP-44):** Use NDK helper methods to perform keypair-based encryption between sender’s private key and recipient’s public key, producing an encrypted payload formatted per NIP-44 spec (version 0x02). This payload is then embedded in the event’s content field.

- **Event creation:** Call `createEvent()` or equivalent NDK API with:
  - `kind: 14`
  - `pubkey:` sender's pubkey
  - `created_at:` current timestamp
  - `tags:` array including `["p", recipientPubkey, relayUrl]` and optionally `["e", parentEventId, relayUrl]`
  - `content:` the NIP-44 encrypted message string

- **Publishing:** Use NDK’s relay publishing methods to send the event to appropriate relays (preferably those listed under kind:10050 or as per client relay recommendations).

### APIs in @nostr-dev-kit/ndk v2.14.35:

- **`ndk.nip44.encrypt(senderPrivateKey, recipientPubKey, message)`**
  - Encrypts a message using NIP-44 scheme.

- **`ndk.nip44.decrypt(recipientPrivateKey, senderPubKey, encryptedContent)`**
  - Decrypts incoming messages.

- **`ndk.createEvent({ kind, pubkey, created_at, tags, content })`**
  - Creates an event object with specified fields.

- **`ndk.signAndSendEvent(event)`** *or* **`ndk.publish(event)`**
  - Signs (if applicable to event kind) and publishes the event to relays.

### Sample code sketch:

```typescript
import NDK from "@nostr-dev-kit/ndk";

const ndk = new NDK({ /* relay configs */ });

await ndk.connect();

const senderPrivateKey = "...";
const recipientPubKey = "...";
const message = "Hello, this is a private message";

// Encrypt message using NIP-44
const encryptedContent = ndk.nip44.encrypt(senderPrivateKey, recipientPubKey, message);

// Build NIP-17 direct message event
const event = ndk.createEvent({
  kind: 14,
  pubkey: ndk.getPublicKey(senderPrivateKey), 
  created_at: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000),
  tags: [
    ["p", recipientPubKey, "wss://relay.example.com"]
  ],
  content: encryptedContent
});

// Publish event to relays
await ndk.publish(event);
```

### Important notes:

- **NIP-17 events (kind 14)** are meant for private direct messaging and *must not* be fully signed to avoid leaking plaintext messages. NDK likely handles this internally or offers appropriate methods.

- **Relays:** Clients should connect to trusted relay sets defined in their kind:10050 list (NIP-17 recommendation).

- **NIP-44 encryption (v0x02)** is the current recommended scheme for the encrypted payload format.

- **Tag structure** is crucial for clients to route and display messages correctly.

This approach aligns with the specs detailed in NIP-17 (private message format and tags) and NIP-44 (encryption algorithms and payload format) as outlined by nostr documentation and NDK code references[1][2][6].
